	1 : """There is <r>trouble<C> in Leafy Glade!

Someone has been stealing from travellers as they pass through this sleepy little village.

It is up to you to solve the mystery...

Leafy Glade is a short demo adventure made to test the basic functionality of the OlderScrolls engine on all hardware targets as well as various game scripting logic elements.""",

	2 : """You are standing in the centre of the market in Leafy Glade.

Leafy Glade is a small, but bustling village located at the junction of several popular trade routes.

Its inhabitants are mostly self-sufficient farmers and vendors of handcrafted goods.

For a long time Leafy Glade has traded well to travellers; those who use the village as a stopping off point for the trade routes that converge near the village on the way to larger towns in the region.

You can hear the shouts of vendors of various stalls and a see steady stream of travellers, in small groups as well as individuals, winding their way through the carts and barrows - selling everything from fruit and grains to wines, traditional clothing and household tools.""", 	

3 : """You are at the northern edge of Leafy Glade.

You can see several marker posts which point off to the routes that travellers take on their way to the larger towns.

One of the markers points <g>north<C>, heading <g>south<C> would take you back to the market.""",

4 : "You see a small clearing which is surrounded on three sides by deep, thick brambles. A lean-to canvas shelter is to the rear of the clearing and the remnants of a small fire smoulder in front of the shelter.",
	5 : "A signpost in the centre of the market points to the <g>northern<C> edge of the village, indicating that is where you find the route markers to the various towns and settlements throughout the region.",
	6 : "A shady looking character is standing in the clearing close to you.\n\n'Who do you think YOU are?'\n'Get away from here - you are not taking my hard earned loot!'",
	7 : "The motionless body of a thief lays close to the entrance of the clearing.",
	8 : "'You, yes you!'\nThe well dressed figure motions you closer.\n'I have a job for you. Take this stick and go and beat some sense into that thief who has been robbing visitors to our village. Unless we can stop this ongoing theft, no-one will want to stay at our village.'\n\nHe offers a sturdy wooden stick to you.",
	9 : "'Thank you for taking care of our little problem.'\n'You are always welcome to stay in Leafy Glade.'",
	10 : "Nothing",
	11 : "Clothing which is reinforced with multiple layers of padded material. Offers minimal protection over normal clothing.",
	12 : "An outfit covered with many metal studs. Whilst not providing protection equivalent to armour, defence is improved over other types of clothing.",
	13 : "A happy little hat which sits at a jaunty angle.",
	14 : "A sturdy wooden branch. It is long-and-heavy enough to require two hands to hold it effectively. Swung with enough force, it could easily maim someone.",
	15 : "A knife. The type of tool a butcher or leather worker may use. Whilst not especially well balanced or finely crafted, it can cause just as lethal a wound as an expensive knife from a weaponsmith can."
