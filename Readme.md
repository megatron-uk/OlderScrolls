# OlderScrolls

OlderScrolls is a D&D style RPG game engine for various 8bit and 16bit consoles and computers of the 1980's and 1990's.

The intention is to provide a single, complete game engine that can be used to implement a different adventure by simply changing the datafiles that it uses.

# Games

The engine can be built with several game datafiles to produce multiple stand alone games. 

For technical details of the game datafile formats, please look [here](datafiles/Readme.md).

The games included with the engine are:

  * ### Leafy Glade

This is a basic, sample game data set that is used to test basic functionality of the various engine targets and changes to the engine itself.

See more [details](datafiles/leafy_glade/Readme.md)

  * ### Sands of Terror

A more full-featured game set in a typical D&D desert world, with a quest to solve, party members to recruit, loot to find and monsters to kill.

See more [details](datafiles/sand_of_terror/Readme.md)
